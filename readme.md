# Genetic Color

This is a simple genetic algorithm that evolves a population of colors to match a target color. The fitness of each organism is calculated by finding the distance between the colors (as vectors in 3d space). The algorithm uses a tournament selection process to select the best colors to breed and mutate. The colors are then crossed over to create new colors. The algorithm continues to evolve the population until the target color is reached.

## Simulation

Simple simulation built with tkinter. The simulation will display the target color, the best color in the population, and the generation number. You can also change the target color and or restart the simulation.
